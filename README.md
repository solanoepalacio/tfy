## Topic Focused Youtube
1st Vibe coding attempt using [OpenCode](http://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) and [GSD](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)

Wants to be a version of youtube that "proxies" recomendations and tries to filter of topic videos suggested to help me stay focused on the topic I'm researching (eg: avoid showing cooking videos while I'm researching about computer science)
