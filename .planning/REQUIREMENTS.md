# Requirements: TFY — Topic Focused YouTube

**Defined:** 2026-02-24
**Core Value:** When watching a YouTube video, the sidebar suggestions stay on-topic with what you're currently watching — eliminating cross-interest distraction during focused research sessions.

## v1.2 Requirements

### Documentation

- [ ] **DOC-01**: Reader understands what TFY does and why it exists (motivation + problem statement)
- [ ] **DOC-02**: Reader understands this extension is a POC built entirely by AI agents as an agentic engineering exercise
- [ ] **DOC-03**: Reader can identify prerequisites before installing (Chrome, Google Cloud project, YouTube Data API v3 key)
- [ ] **DOC-04**: Reader can install the extension in Chrome developer mode from a fresh clone
- [ ] **DOC-05**: Reader can configure the extension by entering their YouTube Data API v3 key in the popup
- [ ] **DOC-06**: Reader understands daily usage — how filtering works, the popup toggle, collapsed labels, and Shorts suppression

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Contributing guide | Personal-use POC, no external contributors expected |
| Changelog / release notes | Not needed for single-user dev project |
| Automated docs generation | README is hand-written prose, no tooling needed |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DOC-01 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| DOC-02 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| DOC-03 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| DOC-04 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| DOC-05 | Phase 5 | Pending |
