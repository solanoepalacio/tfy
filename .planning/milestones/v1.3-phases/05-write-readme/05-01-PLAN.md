<objective>
Write README.md that fully covers TFY's purpose, agentic POC origin, prerequisites, install, API key configuration, and daily usage.

Purpose: Phase 5 exists entirely to document the extension for any reader starting cold. A reader who follows this README should be able to install, configure, and use TFY with no other context.

Output: /README.md — the sole artifact of this phase.

  <name>Task 1: Write README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md in the project root with the following sections in order. Write in clear, direct prose — no marketing fluff, no emoji overload, one emoji maximum per section heading if any.

**Section 1 — Header + One-liner**
- Title: `TFY — Topic Focused YouTube`
- One-sentence description: what it does (collapses off-topic sidebar suggestions on YouTube watch pages so only same-category videos remain visible)

**Section 2 — What it does (DOC-01)**
Two to three short paragraphs:
- The problem: YouTube sidebar constantly surfaces unrelated content (gaming suggestions while researching tech, entertainment while watching science) that pulls focus during research sessions.
- The solution: TFY compares each sidebar suggestion's category to the current video's category using the YouTube Data API v3. Off-topic suggestions are collapsed (not removed from the DOM) with a label showing the video's title and category. The Shorts shelf is unconditionally hidden on watch pages.
- Behavior detail: filtering re-runs automatically when navigating between videos via YouTube's SPA navigation. A popup toggle lets the user disable/re-enable filtering without reloading the page.

**Section 3 — Agentic POC (DOC-02)**
Short callout block (blockquote or bold note):
- State explicitly: TFY was built entirely by AI agents — Claude Code running a GSD (Get Shit Done) agentic workflow — with zero human-written code.
- Frame it as an agentic engineering proof-of-concept: every phase (extension scaffold, sidebar filtering, popup controls, observability, this README) was planned and executed by Claude agents.
- The human role was product direction only.

**Section 4 — Prerequisites (DOC-03)**
Bulleted list — exactly these three items:
1. Chrome browser (Manifest V3 extension, Chrome only)
2. A Google Cloud project with the YouTube Data API v3 enabled
3. A YouTube Data API v3 key from that project

Include a one-line link or pointer to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) for the API key. Do NOT walk through the GCP console UI — just point there. The reader already has or knows how to get a Google Cloud API key.

**Section 5 — Install (DOC-04)**
Numbered steps for loading the extension in Chrome developer mode from a fresh clone:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url> && cd tfy`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `tfy` project folder (the directory containing `manifest.json`)
5. The TFY extension icon appears in the toolbar

No build step needed — this is a plain JS extension, no compilation required.

**Section 6 — Configure: Enter Your API Key (DOC-05)**
Numbered steps:
1. Click the TFY icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup
2. Paste your YouTube Data API v3 key into the input field
3. Click **Save**
4. Navigate to any YouTube watch page (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`)
5. Open the Chrome DevTools console — you should see `[TFY]` log entries showing the detected video category

**Section 7 — Usage (DOC-06)**
Short prose + bullets:
- Filtering is automatic: once the API key is set, TFY filters the sidebar on every YouTube watch page without any interaction required.
- Collapsed items: Off-topic sidebar suggestions are visually collapsed to a thin bar. The bar shows a label in the format `hidden: {Category} · {Title}` so the user knows what was hidden.
- Shorts suppression: The YouTube Shorts shelf is hidden on all watch pages, regardless of filtering state.
- Toggle: Click the TFY popup icon, use the checkbox to disable or re-enable filtering instantly. The toggle state persists across browser restarts.
- SPA navigation: When clicking to a new YouTube video without a full page reload, TFY re-filters the sidebar for the new video automatically.

**Formatting rules:**
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Code strings (URLs, `chrome://extensions`, `manifest.json`, `[TFY]`) in backticks
- Section headings as `##` (H2)
- Keep total length readable — aim for 80-150 lines, dense but not padded
- No license section, no contributing guide, no changelog (out of scope per REQUIREMENTS.md)

  <how-to-verify>
    Read README.md cold — pretend you have no prior knowledge of the project.

    Verify each success criterion:
    1. Can you state what TFY does and what problem it solves after reading the first two sections?
    2. Is the agentic POC note clearly present and unambiguous (built entirely by AI agents)?
    3. Are exactly three prerequisites listed (Chrome, Google Cloud project, YouTube Data API v3 key)?
    4. Do the install steps get you from `git clone` to a loaded Chrome extension in 5 numbered steps?
    5. Do the configure steps tell you how to enter the API key and confirm it's working?
    6. Does the Usage section explain collapsed labels, Shorts suppression, and the toggle?

    Check: Is `chrome://extensions` mentioned in the install steps?
    Check: Does the README link to or mention the Google Cloud Console for the API key?
    Check: Is the agentic POC note explicit — "built entirely by AI agents" or equivalent phrasing?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all six criteria pass, or describe what is missing or unclear</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
- README.md exists at project root
- `wc -l README.md` returns >= 80
- All six sections present (What it does, Agentic POC, Prerequisites, Install, Configure, Usage)
- Human has reviewed and approved the README cold-read test
- All DOC-01 through DOC-06 requirements satisfied
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 5 is complete when:
1. README.md exists and covers all six DOC requirements
2. A human has read it cold and confirmed all five phase success criteria pass
3. No other file is required to understand, install, configure, or use TFY
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-write-readme/05-01-SUMMARY.md` with:
- What was written (sections, key content decisions)
- Any wording choices worth preserving for consistency
- Phase 5 complete status
</output>
